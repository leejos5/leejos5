# Hello!

## bout Me

I am Joshua Lee, a senior Computer Science student at the University of Washington with a strong interest in software development, particularly **Front End Development**. I am planning to graduate in June 2022 with my Bachelor of Science in **Computer Science and Systems.** 

I enjoy developing my technical skills through my coursework, participating in Hackathons, and pursuing personal projects with everyday practical applications. I have experience utilizing languages such as **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Python**, and **C**.

Outside of my tech bubble, I am currently a **NEAR Peer Mentor** for underserved high school STEM students and a **Business Analytics Intern** for the CleanTech Open Startup Accelerator.

I greatly enjoy playing and analyzing competitive video games. I love being in positions of leadership where I can mentor and assist others.
